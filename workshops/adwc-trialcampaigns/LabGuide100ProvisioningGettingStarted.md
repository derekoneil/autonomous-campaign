# ADWC Lab 100: Provisioning and Getting Started

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud (ADWC) on Oracle Infrastructure Cloud (OCI). You will provision a new ADWC database and connect to the database using Oracle SQL Developer.

To **log issues**, click [here](https://github.com/millerhoo/journey4-adwc/issues/new) to go to the github oracle repository issue submission form.

## Objectives

-   Learn how to provision an ADWC instance

-   Learn how to connect to ADWC

## Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

-   Oracle SQL Developer 18.1 (see [Oracle Technology Network download site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/overview/index.html)).
    Please be sure to use SQL Developer version 18.1 or later because this version contains enhancements for key Autonomous DW Cloud features. 

    * Note *: If you are a Windows user on 64-bit platform, download the 'Windows 64-bit with JDK 8 included' distribution as it includes both Java 8 and the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) files necessary to run SQL Developer and connect to your Autonomous DW Cloud.
    If you are a non-Windows user, download and install the appropriate [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for your Operating System. Download and extract the [Java Cryptography Encryption Archive](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html) to the directory as indicated in the README.txt.

# Section 1. Provisioning an ADWC Instance

-  Click on **Create Autonomous Date Warehouse** button to start the instance creation process

![](./images/100/Picture100-23.jpeg)

-  This will bring up Create Autonomous Data Warehouse screen where you specify the configurations of the instance

![](./images/100/Picture100-24.jpeg)

-  Click on **Click here** to enable compartment selection so that the ADWC instance is in a specific compartment

![](./images/100/Picture100-25.jpeg)

-  Select a compartment of your choice

![](./images/100/Picture100-26.jpeg)

-  Specify a name for the instance

![](./images/100/Picture100-27.jpeg)

-  You can update the storage size if needed

![](./images/100/Picture100-28.jpeg)

-  Then specify the password for the instance

![](./images/100/Picture100-29.jpeg)

-  Make sure you have everything fill out

![](./images/100/Picture100-30.jpeg)

-  Click on **Create Autonomous Data Warehouse** to start provisioning the instance

![](./images/100/Picture100-31.jpeg)

![](./images/100/Picture100-32.jpeg)

-  Once it finishes provisioning, you can click on the instance name to see details of it

![](./images/100/Picture100-33.jpeg)

You now have created your first Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud instance.

# Section 2. Connecting to ADWC

## Downloading the credentials wallet


As ADWC only accepts secure connections to the database, you need to download a wallet file containing your credentials first. The wallet is downloaded from the ADWC service console.

## Steps

### **STEP 3: Sign in to the Service Console**

-   In the instance details page find your database and click **Service Console** 

![](./images/100/Picture100-34.jpeg)

-   This will open a new browser tab for the service console. Sign in to the service console with the following information.

    -   **Username:** admin

    -   **Password:** The administrator password you specified during provisioning

![](./images/100/Picture100-35.jpeg)

### **STEP 4: Download the credentials wallet**

-   Click the “**Administration**” tab and click “**Download Client Credentials**” to download the wallet.

![](./images/100/Picture100-15.png)

-   Specify a password of your choice for the wallet, you will need this password when connecting to the database later. Click **Download** to download the wallet file to your client machine.

## Connecting to the database using SQL Developer

Start SQL Developer and create a connection for your database using the default administrator account, ADMIN, by following these steps.

## Steps

### **STEP 5: Connect to the database using SQL Developer**

-   Click the **Create Connection** icon in the Connections toolbox on the top left of the SQL Developer homepage.

![](./images/100/snap0014653.jpg)

-   Fill in the connection details as below:

    -   **Connection Name:** admin_low

    -   **Username:** admin

    -   **Password:** The password you specified during provisioning

    -   **Connection Type:** Cloud PDB

    -   **Configuration File:** Enter the full path for the wallet file you downloaded before, or click the **Browse button** to point to the location of the file.

    -   **Keystore Password:** The password you specified when downloading the wallet from the ADWC service console

    -   **Service:** There are 3 pre-configured database services for each database. Pick **&lt;databasename&gt;_low** for this lab. For
        example, if you created a database named testdw select testdw_low as the service.

![](./images/100/Picture100-18.png)

-   Test your connection by clicking the **Test** button, if it succeeds save your connection information by clicking **Save**, then connect to your database by clicking the **Connect** button. An entry for the new connection appears under Connections.

-   Create another connection named as **admin_high** using the same information as above, this time pick **&lt;databasename&gt;_high** as the service name, for example, testdw_high.

-   You are now ready to move to the next lab.
